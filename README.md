# Traffic-Sign-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning-in-Python-Keras
The above project is guided under coursera.
In this project we are building a traffic sign classifier. This classifier is used to recognize different traffic signs. This helps to build smarter and self driving cars. 
In this projest we have used Convulational Neural Network to train and classify the data. The dataset used is provided by Coursera.
We have achieved an accuracy of 87% while predicting the dataset.

In this case study, we want to classify images of traffic signs using deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

#################################################APPENDIX##################################################

The dataset consists of 43 different classes of images.

Classes are as listed below:

0 = Speed limit (20km/h)

1 = Speed limit (30km/h)

2 = Speed limit (50km/h)

3 = Speed limit (60km/h)

4 = Speed limit (70km/h)

5 = Speed limit (80km/h)

6 = End of speed limit (80km/h)

7 = Speed limit (100km/h)

8 = Speed limit (120km/h)

9 = No passing

10 = No passing for vehicles over 3.5 metric tons

11 = Right-of-way at the next intersection

12 = Priority road

13 = Yield

14 = Stop

15 = No vehicles

16 = Vehicles over 3.5 metric tons prohibited

17 = No entry

18 = General caution

19 = Dangerous curve to the left

20 = Dangerous curve to the right

21 = Double curve

22 = Bumpy road

23 = Slippery road

24 = Road narrows on the right

25 = Road work

26 = Traffic signals

27 = Pedestrians

28 = Children crossing

29 = Bicycles crossing

30 = Beware of ice/snow

31 = Wild animals crossing

32 = End of all speed and passing limits

33 = Turn right ahead

34 = Turn left ahead

35 = Ahead only

36 = Go straight or right

37 = Go straight or left

38 = Keep right

39 = Keep left

40 = Roundabout mandatory

41 = End of no passing

42 = End of no passing by vehicles over 3.5 metric tons
