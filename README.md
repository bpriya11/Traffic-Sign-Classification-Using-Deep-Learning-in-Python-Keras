# Traffic-Sign-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning-in-Python-Keras
The above project is guided under coursera.
In this project we are building a traffic sign classifier. This classifier is used to recognize different traffic signs. This helps to build smarter and self driving cars. 
In this projest we have used Convulational Neural Network to train and classify the data. The dataset used is provided by Coursera.
We have achieved an accuracy of 87% while predicting the dataset.
